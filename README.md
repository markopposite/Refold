# refold

### A script collaboration used to refold marginal pulsar candidates within the zuul05/GBNCC server.
### The refold script is built to run in a subfolder from the main GBNCC directory to find marginal candidates that are listed in a csv file and construct lists of the .fits filenames, subdirectory paths using the C1234+56 csv filename, as well as the subdirectories themselves, and a dictionary to be keyed by any of the csv headers to find the .fits filename.
### In addition, the refold script is designed to refold and store the candidates within a subfolder to be analyzed by the user.
